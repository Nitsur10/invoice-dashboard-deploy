- Missing In Review & Approved filters
- Pending card was amber (inconsistent with Dashboard)

**After:**
- All 5 clickable status cards (Pending, In Review, Approved, Paid, Overdue)
- Pending card is blue (consistent with Dashboard)
- Grid layout updated to accommodate 7 cards

### Dashboard Page
**Before:**
- Status cards were non-interactive (display only)
- No way to drill down into filtered views

**After:**
