# ADR-007: Invoice Filter Interface Redesign - Sidebar to Popover Migration

**Date:** 2025-09-24
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Authors:** Development Team
**Related Issue:** [Issue-007: Invoice Filter UI Redesign](../issues/issue-007-invoice-filter-ui.md)

## Context

The RPD Invoice Dashboard initially implemented invoice filtering using a left sidebar layout on desktop and a drawer on mobile. This approach consumed significant horizontal screen real estate (280px fixed width) and created inconsistent UX patterns across the application, particularly when compared to the Kanban board's popover-based filter system.

### Problems with the Previous Implementation

1. **Space Inefficiency**: Fixed 280px left sidebar reduced content viewing area
2. **UX Inconsistency**: Different filter patterns between Invoices (sidebar) and Kanban (popover)
3. **Responsive Complexity**: Maintaining separate desktop sidebar and mobile drawer components
4. **Visual Clutter**: Persistent sidebar presence even when filters weren't being used
5. **Accessibility Gaps**: Limited focus management and ARIA support in sidebar layout

### User Experience Goals

- Maximize content viewing area for invoice data
- Create consistent filter UX patterns across the application
- Improve mobile experience with better space utilization
- Enhance accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Maintain all existing filtering functionality without disruption

## Decision

We decided to **migrate from a sidebar-based filter interface to a popover-based system** that matches the existing Kanban board pattern.

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Component Architecture
- **New Component**: `InvoiceFilterPopover` as the main filter interface
- **Enhanced Existing**: Modified `InvoiceFilterForm` to support layout variants
- **Responsive Strategy**: Desktop popover + Mobile drawer (reuse existing drawer)
- **State Management**: Zero changes to `useInvoiceFilters` hook for full backward compatibility

#### 2. Layout Strategy
- **Remove Fixed Grid**: Eliminated `lg:grid-cols-[280px,1fr]` layout constraint
- **Full-Width Content**: Invoice table and controls use complete available width
- **Toolbar Integration**: Filter trigger positioned next to Export CSV button
- **Visual Consistency**: Match Kanban board filter button styling and behavior

#### 3. User Interface Design
- **Filter Button**: Outline style with Filter icon and "Filters" label
- **Active Filter Badge**: Secondary badge showing count of active filters
- **Popover Dimensions**: 384px width (`w-96`) for optimal content display
- **Positioning**: End-aligned with 8px offset for visual separation

#### 4. Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop (≥1024px)**: Popover interface with floating content
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Existing drawer interface maintained
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: Popover interface (same as desktop)

#### 5. Technical Implementation
- **UI Framework**: RadixUI Popover primitives for robust behavior
- **Accessibility First**: Comprehensive ARIA labels, focus management, keyboard support
- **Performance**: Lazy facet loading, optimized rerenders with useMemo
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing filter APIs and hooks unchanged

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Modal-Based Filters
**Pros:** More space for complex filters, better mobile experience
**Cons:** Heavier interaction pattern, breaks visual context with data
**Decision:** Rejected - Too disruptive for frequent filter adjustments

### Alternative 2: Collapsible Sidebar
**Pros:** Maintains sidebar familiarity, can be hidden when not needed
**Cons:** Still consumes space when open, adds complexity with collapse state
**Decision:** Rejected - Doesn't solve space efficiency or UX consistency issues

### Alternative 3: Header-Integrated Filters
**Pros:** Always visible, compact inline layout
**Cons:** Limited space for complex filters, clutters header navigation
**Decision:** Rejected - Insufficient space for comprehensive filtering options

### Alternative 4: Hybrid Approach (Selected)
**Pros:** Matches Kanban UX, space efficient, accessibility focused, responsive
**Cons:** Requires development of new popover component
**Decision:** ✅ Selected - Best balance of UX consistency and functionality

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```typescript
// New popover component
interface InvoiceFilterPopoverProps {
  facets?: InvoiceFacetsResponse['facets']
  isLoading?: boolean
  className?: string
  onClose?: () => void
}

// Enhanced form component with variant support
interface InvoiceFilterFormProps {
  // ... existing props
  variant?: 'sidebar' | 'drawer' | 'popover' // New prop
}
```

### Accessibility Implementation
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus handling on open/close
- **ARIA Labels**: Comprehensive labeling for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with escape key handling
- **Screen Reader**: Active filter count announcements and descriptions

### Active Filter Badge Logic
```typescript
const activeFilterCount = useMemo(() => {
  let count = 0
  if (filters.statuses.length > 0) count += filters.statuses.length
  if (filters.categories.length > 0) count += filters.categories.length
  if (filters.vendors.length > 0) count += filters.vendors.length
  if (filters.dateRange) count += 1
  if (filters.amountRange) count += 1
  if (filters.search) count += 1
  return count
}, [filters])
```

## Benefits

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Space Efficiency**: ~280px additional content width on desktop
2. **UX Consistency**: Unified filter pattern across Invoices and Kanban
3. **Visual Cleanliness**: Filters hidden until needed, reducing interface clutter
4. **Mobile Experience**: Better space utilization with existing proven drawer pattern
5. **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA support and keyboard navigation

### Long-term Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Easier to extend with additional filter types
2. **Maintenance**: Single filter pattern to maintain across components
3. **User Familiarity**: Consistent interaction patterns reduce learning curve
4. **Performance**: Popover-based rendering optimizations
5. **Testing**: Simplified test scenarios with unified component structure

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: User Adaptation
**Risk:** Users accustomed to sidebar layout may find new pattern unfamiliar
**Mitigation:** Filter button is prominently placed with clear visual indicators (icon + badge)
**Status:** Mitigated - Button placement next to Export CSV follows established pattern

### Risk 2: Mobile Regression
**Risk:** Changes could negatively impact mobile filter experience
**Mitigation:** Reused existing mobile drawer implementation without modifications
**Status:** Mitigated - Mobile behavior unchanged, only desktop layout affected

### Risk 3: Popover Positioning Issues
**Risk:** Popover may not position correctly on different screen sizes
**Mitigation:** RadixUI handles positioning automatically with fallback strategies
**Status:** Mitigated - Comprehensive positioning configuration with align="end" and sideOffset

### Risk 4: Filter State Loss
**Risk:** Popover closure could disrupt filter application
**Mitigation:** State managed by existing `useInvoiceFilters` hook, independent of popover state
**Status:** Mitigated - Filter state persists across popover open/close cycles
