issues:
  - title: "Fix dashboard trend percentage logic"
    body: |
      Problem: Stats cards treat absolute totals as percentages, showing values like “125.0%” for 125 invoices.
      Impact: Finance stakeholders receive misleading KPIs and may make incorrect decisions.
      Recommendation:
        - Adjust `/api/stats` to return true month-over-month deltas (or `N/A` when unavailable).
        - Update `StatsCards` to render the new delta fields and guard against null values.
        - Add lightweight validation/tests to prevent regressions.
      Acceptance:
        - Dashboard trend badges display correct percentages or `N/A` when no prior data exists.
        - API contract documents the new fields and passes automated checks.
      Notes: See `docs/issues/issue-001-trend-delta.md` for background.

  - title: "Refine invoice status derivation across APIs"
    body: |
      Problem: `deriveInvoiceStatus` marks all invoices issued before 1 May 2025 as paid, hiding potential overdue items.
      Impact: Dashboard and invoice list under-report outstanding liabilities.
      Recommendation:
        - Respect stored status fields when present and remove the unconditional pre-2025 paid rule.
        - Derive pending/overdue status using `amount_due` and `due_date` regardless of issue date.
        - Ensure both `/api/invoices` and `/api/stats` share the corrected logic.
      Acceptance:
        - Legacy invoices (if present) reflect true status in list and metrics.
        - Regression tests or logs confirm consistent behaviour post-2025.

  - title: "Surface stats API failures with user feedback"
    body: |
      Problem: `fetchDashboardStats` swallows errors and returns zero values, making outages appear as empty data.
      Impact: Users assume business performance collapsed instead of noticing an API failure.
      Recommendation:
        - Propagate errors through React Query so `DashboardStatsProvider` reports `isError`.
        - Show an error card/toast with retry on the dashboard when the API fails.
        - Log failures for observability.
      Acceptance:
        - Simulated API failure shows error UI instead of zero stats.
        - Successful calls remain unaffected.
      Notes: See `docs/issues/issue-003-stats-error-handling.md`.

  - title: "Harden Supabase admin client configuration"
    body: |
      Problem: `supabaseAdmin` initialises with an undefined service-role key when env vars are missing, leading to runtime crashes.
      Impact: Local developers and misconfigured deploys fail without actionable guidance.
      Recommendation:
        - Lazily create the client only when both URL and key are present.
        - Emit descriptive errors or fall back to mock data when configuration is incomplete.
        - Add documentation/tests covering the missing-env scenario.
      Acceptance:
        - Local run without service key yields clear warning and mock data, not a crash.
        - Production startup fails fast with actionable messaging if env vars absent.
      Notes: See `docs/issues/issue-004-supabase-env.md`.

  - title: "Implement month-over-month trend metrics pipeline"
    body: |
      Problem: Dashboard lacks reliable MoM analytics sourced from Supabase/n8n workflow outputs.
      Impact: Finance teams cannot track growth or regression accurately.
      Recommendation:
        - Create a Supabase materialized view (or table) that aggregates invoices by month starting 1 May 2025.
        - Update `/api/stats` to consume the view and compute MoM percentage deltas.
        - Ensure `StatsCards` render the new data with fallbacks when prior month missing.
      Acceptance:
        - Materialized view/script checked into repo; refresh strategy documented.
        - API and UI display correct MoM metrics validated against sample data.

  - title: "Make status summary cards act as quick filters"
    body: |
      Problem: Summary cards on the invoices page (Pending/Paid/Overdue) are static and don’t adjust the table.
      Impact: Users expect to click the cards to drill into matching invoices.
      Recommendation:
        - Hook card clicks into `useInvoiceFilters` to set/clear the status filter.
        - Provide toggle behaviour so clicking an active card removes the filter.
        - Ensure accessibility (keyboard activation + ARIA feedback) and mobile support.
      Acceptance:
        - Clicking Pending shows only pending invoices; Paid and Overdue behave similarly.
        - Clicking an active card again clears the filter and restores previous view.
        - Filter chips/sidebar reflect the active status.

  - title: "Move invoice filters to top-right popover"
    body: |
      Problem: Invoice filters live in a left sidebar/drawer; facets often appear blank and UX differs from Kanban board.
      Impact: Feels inconsistent and wastes horizontal space.
      Recommendation:
        - Replace sidebar with a top-right filter button (next to Export CSV) that opens a populated popover.
        - Preload facets (status/category/vendor) so options appear immediately or show skeleton while loading.
        - Preserve existing filter syncing with chips/context; ensure mobile users get the drawer treatment.
      Acceptance:
        - Filter button opens a compact panel containing all available filter controls with populated options.
        - Sidebar removed; layout resembles Kanban filter behaviour.
        - Works with keyboard, screen readers, and mobile breakpoints.

  - title: "Replace supplier column with description in invoice list"
    body: |
      Problem: The invoice table shows supplier name; stakeholders prefer to see the description (line one) with hover for full text.
      Impact: Users scan for descriptions and currently have to drill into details.
      Recommendation:
        - Swap the supplier column for a description column with truncation and tooltip on hover.
        - Ensure full description is accessible for keyboard users (focus tooltip).
        - Keep supplier data available via filters/export as needed.
      Acceptance:
        - Table displays truncated description; hovering/focusing reveals full text.
        - Layout remains responsive; no loss of supplier filtering capability.
      Notes: See `docs/issues/issue-008-invoice-description-column.md`.

  - title: "Fix invoice summary cards to show database totals not page counts"
    body: |
      Problem: Invoice page summary cards (Pending/Paid/Overdue) calculate counts from current page data only, not the entire database.
      Impact: When users navigate to page 2+, the status counts are misleading and don't reflect true business metrics.
      Recommendation:
        - Move status aggregation from client-side to backend in `/api/invoices` response or create dedicated stats endpoint.
        - Update invoices page to display true database totals for each status regardless of pagination.
        - Maintain "Current Page Total" as page-specific sum while other cards show global counts.
        - Use efficient database aggregation (e.g., COUNT with GROUP BY) to avoid performance issues.
      Acceptance:
        - Pending/Paid/Overdue cards display accurate totals across entire database.
        - Counts remain correct when user changes pages or applies filters.
        - Stats load performantly (< 500ms) and don't degrade table loading speed.
        - Total Invoices count continues to work correctly from pagination.total.
      Notes: See `docs/issues/issue-009-invoice-stats-accuracy.md`. Current bug at `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/page.tsx:172-184`.

  - title: "Implement mobile & desktop responsive design"
    body: |
      Problem: Dashboard uses fixed 288px sidebar layout that breaks on mobile devices (< 768px). Invoice table with 10+ columns is unusable on small screens. Users cannot access navigation, view invoices, or interpret charts on mobile.
      Impact: Mobile users (field workers, executives) cannot use the application, limiting accessibility and market reach.
      Recommendation:
        - Refactor layout to use collapsible sidebar with mobile drawer pattern (hamburger menu).
        - Implement card-based mobile view for invoice table as alternative to horizontal scroll.
        - Optimize dashboard grids and charts for tablet (768-1024px) and mobile (< 768px) breakpoints.
        - Ensure touch-friendly interactions (44x44px minimum) and accessibility compliance.
        - Add responsive utility hooks (useMediaQuery, useBreakpoint) for component logic.
      Acceptance:
        - Sidebar collapses to drawer on mobile with hamburger toggle; main content adjusts padding.
        - Invoice table renders as card list on mobile, shows essential data with expand option.
        - Dashboard grids use responsive columns (1 → 2 → 4 → 5 based on viewport).
        - Charts readable on mobile with appropriate heights and label strategies.
        - All touch targets ≥ 44x44px; no horizontal scroll on any viewport.
        - Lighthouse mobile score > 90; E2E tests pass on mobile viewports.
        - Desktop experience maintained without regressions.
      Notes: See docs/issues/issue-010-mobile-responsiveness.md and docs/findings/mobile-responsiveness-assessment.md. Estimated effort: 15-25 days.
